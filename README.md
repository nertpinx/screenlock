# Automatic bluetooth screen lock

Everything is better with bluetooth, even your screenlock.

Lock your screen when bluetooth device disconnects.

Automatically lock your screen when bluetooth device disconnects for "improved" security.  This is not finished, just something I wanted to try out and basically ended with this.  This will never be finished.

Clone the repo and run `cargo run`, You should be provided an information when BT device is (dis)connected.
